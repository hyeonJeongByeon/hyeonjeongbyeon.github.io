I am a second year Ph.D. student in the [Human-Centered Design & Engineering](https://www.hcde.washington.edu/) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/), advised by Professors [Gary Hsieh](https://faculty.washington.edu/garyhs/) and [Sean A. Munson](https://www.smunson.com/). 

My research primarily focuses on designing and building LLM-infused systems that encourage people to communicate and interact in ways that are self- and welfare-improving. I extend and build on social science theories and empirically evaluate the effects of these systems. My application areas include behavior change, healthcare, information search, and scientific communication. 

<!--My research primarily focuses on designing and building LLM-infused systems to advocate for positive behavior. Specifically, some of my recent works include: (i) understanding how the personas in LLM affect the credibility of the contents and (ii) exploring the roles of LLMs in making science communication more accessible and trustworthy. -->

Prior to joining UW, I did my undergrad in Computer Science & Engineering (minor in Statistics) at [Ewha Womans University](https://www.ewha.ac.kr/ewhaen/index.do). I also worked at the [Dynamic Graphics Project Lab](https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/) at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) and the [HCI Lab](https://hcil-ewha.github.io/homepage/index.html) at Ewha Womans University as an undergraduate research assistant.
